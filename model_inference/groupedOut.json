I speak for Richard Lionheart... ...King of England. Lord of half of France... ...and thereby overlord of this domain. I'm speaking for myself. -Where are your soldiers? -Run off. -Where is the Lord of Chaluz? -He led them. Ask if he knows about the treasure. Left me with the women and children and no weapons. Here am I with one eye, collecting arrows. And you think I've got a bow to shoot them with? My king thinks your lord is keeping treasure from him. It's my orders to get it. People say it was found by Jean the ploughman. -Great gold statue, 3 foot long. -That's the one. I was with him when they found it. What we dug up was a rock. We're fighting for a rock? You wanna look? Out there in the turnip field. We couldn't lift it, so we left it. What I've come to say is... ...if there's to be a fight, I'm all there is. Come and get me. You're a mad old man. What now? I want to give that rock to Richard. Let's find the turnip field. John. What kind of siege is this? -Where's Lord Chaluz and my treasure? -Gone. My treasure? Gone? The lord is gone. Your treasure never was. A gold statue, 3 foot long. I want it. -Captain. -Yes, my lord. I ordered you to take this castle. -Yes, my lord. -Well, take it. Bring it down and get my statue. They surrender, and your statue is a rock. I want it done. -There is no treasure. -Do it. There are no soldiers, just some children and a mad old man. And what's that to me? Well, it should mean something. Is that disapproval, Robin? Am I in the wrong? I followed you 20 years. I fought in the Crusades and France. I'll fight a soldier... ...but I won't slaughter children for gold. I ordered it. I command you. You do it! You're a bastard, you'll enjoy it. Damn right I'll do it! Mercadier! Arrest those two! I'll have their heads on pikes. I want these walls down. I want every damned head! Lionheart. Lionheart! You are a pig! Good God! Well... ...so it was a stone. -Is this a barber surgeon? -Yes, my lord. I look after your men, sire. -With much success? -Yes. -You've seen to John and Robin? -Under guard. Come on, come on. The patient's cold, and the doctor sweats. The arrow will be hard to reach. That should make it all the more worthwhile. Well, you heard it, Mercadier. I told him to attack, he told me no. I ought to kill him for it. -Will you? -I don't know. It depends on my mood. I killed all of them this afternoon except the old man. I liked his eye. But, Robin.... We've been friends, you see, for 20 years. I met him in Nottingham for the first time. I needed men for the Crusade. Robin was the best. Well, get on with it. I'll die of old age at this rate. So off we went to do great things. We led 300,000 men to the Holy Land, and came back on a boat with 50. Not at all what we intended. Christ! I do what has to be done. I have no choice. But Robin judges me. He always does. The peasant bastard! Judge a king! Butcher. I'll show you how it's done. King's blood. Remember it. It's cold. I don't like the dark. Mercadier, how long to Chaluz? Half a league? Sire. A little rest and then I'll attend to John and Robin. What would you do? Kill the women and children? But they're all dead and we're in here. -No one forced you. -You did. You nodded. What do you want me to do? I know. What did I get us into? I could have talked to Richard. I could have tried. Well, he is a bloody bastard. Are we any better? We serve him. He's our king. I took him for a great king... ...when we were robbing abbots, giving pennies to the poor. It didn't seem much compared to rescuing the Holy Land. How can you eat? I'm hungry. I reckon it's a good life to have reached 40. We've both passed it, and look at us! My poor old dad and all the dads before him... ...lived in Barnesdale. All they ever knew was one town. I've known a king... ...travelled the world, seen Jerusalem. Oh, the sand was blowing and the walls were miles away, but.... I think I've had a good life. Do you think Richard will kill us? I don't know him anymore. I don't know the man. Well, if we go, we go. Is that your idea of dying? I don't know. You'd think I'd learn. I've seen enough of it. I'll tell you something. I won't go quietly. Come here. Bend down. If I had not met you, think what I'd have missed. The king will see you now. Come on. Your Majesty. We are celebrating our demise. I fancied leaving from a larger stage. But a funny fellow, my physician.... I've already had him hanged. It seemed fair. Wine! A bucket of it. But you're not for hanging. You're for cutting up. I would've done it already but for this. -Will that be all, my lord? -All? Damn your ''all'' ! All done. All over. My father cursed me when he died. I killed him, and he felt resentful. He'd have loved all this. I said a bucket. A bucket! John's the next king. You remember John. John Lackland they called him. Now he gets all the land. Christ, why did I have no children? Never cared for England. Never really there. Not even as a corpse! They're planting me in France, by my father! Take something, Robin. Nothing, sire. Oh, he sulks. He pouts. He gives his life to Richard, and he's sorry. You don't know sorrow. I was a king. My mother.... She'll be 80 soon, the bitch. I've sent for her. Do you think she'll come? Bucket.
