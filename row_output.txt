All homegrown.\nPapa takes care of them.\nOK.\nThere comes Papa.\nHow many times did I call you?\nWhy didn\'t you pick up the call?\nWhen did you come?\nAre you about to leave?\nWe came to remind you\nabout Saturday\'s event.\nWe will come even without a reminder.\nThis is Suryan, my friend\nand brother.\n-This is Antony\'s dad.\n-So, you are...?\nI mean, Priya\'s dad.\nJoseph.\n-Nice meeting you.\n-Did they have anything?\nI insisted.

This man...\nWill it be good if I write it?\nYour handwriting is awesome.\nOK, tell me the matter.\n"Dear Sir"\nDaddy, I\'ve just sent it.\nHe might not have seen it.\nLet\'s see how he responds.\nLet Vishal sir reply.\nNo need of it anymore.\nSee this...\nNice one!\nFrom where?\nMy uncle gave it to me.\nCan you give it to me?\nGo away.\nHey...\nHey, Surya...\nStop!\nGive it to me.\nSurya, I will throw\na stone at you, okay?\nStop, man!\nHey...\nStop! I can\'t run anymore, man!\nGive it to me.\nCan you swim across this river?\n-Can you?\n-Yes.\nIn this cold?\nWanna see?\nYeah, I will give this to you\nif you cross this.\nAre you free for five minutes?\nTell me, Papa.\nI\'ve been thinking of telling you\nsomething for a while.\nLong back,\nalmost 48 years ago...\nAn extraordinary event in my life.\nNot sure if you remember.\nMom\'s brother was a priest.\nHe had a Landmaster car.\nTo get rides in it, I\'d go to him\nwhenever possible.\nAt Ponmudi...\nWhen he goes to the town, I\'d be\ngiven responsibility of the church.\nOne day a young lady came\nin search of the priest, crying.\nShe had a child on her shoulder.\nI hadn\'t seen her before that.\nBack then, only the priest\nhad a car there.\nShe must have come\nlooking for that.\nHearing that he wasn\'t there,\nshe walked back dismayed.\nSeeing her running here and\ngoing back slowly, I got suspicious.\nI went in search of her.\nRunning after her, I asked,\n"Why are you crying?"\nShe brushed me aside\nand continued walking.\nI again went after her, caught hold\nof her hand and asked:\n"Why are you crying?"\nThat mother replied in tears,\n"He said my kid will die".\nI asked,\n"Who said?"\nSome village physician,\nit seems.\nThat the kid will die unless he is\ntaken to the Medical College urgently.\n-What was wrong with the child?\n-I didn\'t ask that.\nShe was not in a\nstate of mind to say that also.\nI understood the condition was serious.\nUnable to watch her crying, I said:\n"You want to reach\nthe Medical College? Let\'s go".\nWhat did you say, dear?\nYou said the child can be saved if you\nreach the Medical College soon. Let\'s go.\nYou should have seen the happiness\non her face when I told her this.\nBut I had no idea where the Medical\nCollege was, neither had I gone there.\nMy only friend at that place was Suryan.\nMedical College? How will we take her?\nDo you know the way?\n-Medical College is quite far away.\n-The next bus is only tomorrow.\nYou can get there quickly\nif you go by car.\n-Who has a car here?\n-It\'s the child\'s fate...\nHey, that Mukkili Sahib\nhas a car, right?\nIt will take us one-and-a-half hours\nto reach his house.\nWill he survive till then?\nOliver, where are you taking them?\nReservoir is narrower at the place\nwhere we went that day.\nSahib\'s house is just five minutes\naway from there.\nCrazy or what?\nWhat\'s it?\nWhat?\nThat entire stretch\nis through the forest.\nThere may be elephants\non the way.\nMoreover, how will we cross\nthe river in this cold?\nHey, I have an idea.\n-I am scared, man.\n-Don\'t be.\n-Sure it won\'t sink?\n-Don\'t you know the law of buoyancy?\n-It won\'t sink.\n-I don\'t think this will work.\nWe will know only if we try.\nHow will four of us fit in this?\n-Only they will get inside.\n-So we just have to help them get in?\nWhat?\nNo way. We have to support this\nand swim.\nSwim across?\n-What were you saying before?\n-So what?\n-What\'s this, man?\n-You hold it properly.\nSo cold!\nWhat is this,\nmy dear?\nDon\'t worry.\nBe brave and climb in.\nOnce across, Mukkili Sahib\'s house\nis just five minutes away.\nWe can reach the hospital\nquickly in his car.\n-Did she get in?\n-At first, she hesitated.\nThen I told her something.\nShe climbed into that vessel at once.\n-What did you say?\n-I said...\nIt\'s been so many years.\nI forgot it.\n-Is this a true story?\n-You don\'t believe it. Do you?\nThat\'s the problem with this story.\nI saw an elephant\nrising out of the water.\nNot one, there was an\nentire herd bathing.\nWe became transfixed\nfor a moment.\nWe had to do something.\nReady for anything to happen...\n...I looked the elephant in the eye\nand walked straight ahead.\nYou won\'t believe it. The elephants moved\nto both sides as we walked forward.\nThat\'s fabulous!\nWe got out of the forest in\nfive minutes without a scratch.\nAmazing, Dad.\n-It happened for real, I swear.\n-Well, did I say something?\nBut your face looks like...\n-...you don\'t believe me.\n-Don\'t look at my face then.\nIf you don\'t believe this...\n...you will never believe\nwhat I\'m going to say next.\nWe reached Sahib\'s house and\ncontinued the journey in his car.\n-What\'s so unbelievable in this?\n-I haven\'t told that yet. I\'m going to.\nOn the way, we stopped\nseeing a crowd on the road.\nThe Sahib switched off the vehicle\nand got out to check.\n-What was the issue?\n-Nothing then.\nI also got out.\nBehind me, Suryan too.\nOh, no! The car!\nGod!\nWe ran as fast as we could.\nBehind was a deep valley.\nIt will break into pieces.\nLuckily the vehicle hit a stone\nand slowed down.\nI somehow managed to get in\nand braked the car to a stop.\nYou don\'t believe me?\n-Did you reach the Medical College?\n-Of course.\nWe reached the Medical College, dropped\nthem and came back home in a few hours.\n-What happened to that child?\n-He must have survived.\nThe physician had told he\'ll be fine\nif they reach the Medical College, right?\nOK. Are you done with\nthe extraordinary tale?\nWhat do you think?\n-It\'s fine.\n-No, overall what did you feel?\nOverall I found it quite\nlogical and inspiring.\nGo away, Papa...\nVishal...\nI can guess why he\ndidn\'t like the story.\nYou would have undermined\nmy role in your narration.\nMany of my brave deeds\nmust have seemed like jokes to him.\nNot just you,\nI\'m also a joke now.\nAnyway, he didn\'t say\nhe didn\'t like it.\nNo man, he didn\'t like it.\nI could read it on his face.\nIt\'s late.\nI\'m off...\n-Shall I walk you home?\n-Why?\nHere, wear this.\nNo, I\'ll look like\na monkey with this.\nCome on, man.\nHey, tell me.\nAre you out?\nLook... It\'s Kichu\'s birthday today.\nWe\'re having a party. Tell me...\nVishal\'s reply came.\nPriya...\nWhat are you doing here?\nEveryone\'s waiting. Go there!\nHello, director bro!\nYou don\'t care for us nowadays.\nNot seeing you live these days.\nPost a live. It\'ll be fun!\nDisconnected?\nBitch!\nPop this, okay?\nYour director disconnected the call.\n-Why?\n-Maybe he\'s scared.\nIs this a gift?\nPlay the song.\nLemme cut the cake.\nHappy birthday to you...\nSorry! Sorry!\nCut it.\n-Come on, cut it.\n-Shall I? Are you sure?\nI have told you many times not to\nhang around that scoundrel Kichu.\nYou go around celebrating the birthdays\nof every random person.\nTell that loser scumbag Kichu that\nI\'ll break his head if I ever see him.\nThat will be my next live.\nThat idiot wants to watch my next video.\nAsk him to come.\nI\'ll show it to that bowl-head!\nI told you that already.\nDo what you want.\nWhy are you telling me?\nGet off the call.\nI told you that already.\nI\'m not interested, Priya.\nDo your own shit.\nDon\'t call me.\nDon\'t ask me!\nGet off the call!\nOh my God!\n-How long has it been. Come here!\n-I\'ll come, mommy...\nGive it to me, please...\nHere\'s some sapodilla.\nEarlier when I used to come, she would\nhang around me saying "uncle".\n-This is her own find, right?\n-Where is this from?\nKuttiyamma gave it when\nwe went to Antony\'s house...\nIf he\'s already fighting like this,\nwhat will it be after the wedding?\nIt isn\'t so bad, Justin.\nHe takes good care of his parents.\nHas the same love for us too.\nHe will show that now.\nAnyway I don\'t find\nthis relationship very positive.\n-What are you saying?\n-What\'s wrong in it?\nHow is the family?\nBro...\nOne piece.\nBrother...\nLet\'s see, man.\nTomorrow we\'re visiting them.\nYou are her uncle.\nYou too see.\nSeems the kids have some issue.\nDid he tell you anything?\nShould I call her and ask?\nThey will sort out\nthe issue between them.\nWhy do you want to intervene?\nTo worsen it?\nI haven\'t called, right?\nWas just asking you...\nCall or not, I\'m not\ngonna intervene.\nDid anyone ask you to?\nAsk or not, I\'m not\ngonna intervene.\nGod... My leg!\nDamn films, just to scare people...\nKuttiyamma...\nKuttiyamma...\nCan you get me some water?\nIs everyone asleep?\nSon...\n-Yes, Papa?\n-Any issue with Priya?\nYou mind your own business, Papa!\nKuttiyamma...\nPapa...\n"Hail Mary, Full of Grace,\nThe Lord is with thee..."\n[Continues chanting]\n"Pray for us sinners, now and\nat the hour of our death. Amen."\n-What\'s it?\n-It was you, Papa...\nI thought it was that old hag\nfrom "The Nun".\n-Come here.\n-What?\nIs there any issue between\nPriya and Antony?\n-Tell me before you look at it.\n-Wait! That\'s what I\'m looking at.\nThey are fighting!\nYou can find that out\nthrough this?\nTo know whether they are fighting,\njust check Priya\'s Instagram stories.\nLook at this...\n"I\'m only good at hiding my feelings"\n"Happy birthday, sweetie"\n"My happiest moments ever"\nLook, all these are today\'s updates.\nThere are many similar ones.\nSeeing this, don\'t we feel\nshe\'s very happy? But it isn\'t so.\nShe just wants to irritate him.\nThis is known as\n"Emotional Attyachar".\nPriya dear, this is Papa.\n-Yes, Papa.\n-What happened, daughter?\n-Nothing.\n-Don\'t cry, dear.\nWhy are you crying?\nDon\'t cry...\nOK then. I\'ll call you later.\nDon\'t cry.\nIt was Suryan.\nHe has a stomach upset.\nDo you call him "daughter" now?\nI told you they have some issue.\nI called her. She\'s crying badly.\nCharles said they are\nin some "Emotional Achar".\nWhat sort of achar is it?\nNo idea. You go find.\nOliver, do you know\nwhat\'s Antony\'s real issue?\n-There is a robber with him.\n-Robber?\nDon\'t worry. He\'s now with\nalmost everyone in this world now.\nHere... This is him.\nIt\'s not wealth that he steals.\nIt\'s something no wealth can buy -\nTime.\nSuppose, we are about to start a job.\nWe hear a notification sound...\n...and think we\'ll just\ncheck it for a second.\nWe never realise this one second is\ngrowing into minutes, hours and days.\nFor a creative person like Antony...\non seeing others\' achievements, an\nunwanted comparison and ego will develop.\nAn unnecessary fear that "Only I am\nnot doing anything" sprouts in his mind.\nIf he doesn\'t have the phone\nwith him,\nit\'ll be like a smoking addict\nbeing deprived of cigarettes.\nBut a smoker knows that cigarette smoking\nis injurious to health.\nHe does it with that knowledge.\nBut a smart-phone addict doesn\'t realise\nthat this will affect his mental health...\n...and affect the focus on his work.\nThey\'ll start getting angry\nat people near them.\nSlowly it\'ll start affecting\ntheir family and relationships.\nIsn\'t there a way to cure phone addiction?\nThe only way is to realise\nthat it\'s an addiction.\nThen like any addiction,\nreduce the usage.\nAnd try being at home.\nKeep the robber at a distance.\nMake every moment of life beautiful.\nYou can find your true home.\nLook at what this house\nused to look like!\nIt started with the boys demanding\na room for themselves upstairs.\nAntony had just finished\narchitecture studies.\nTrying out all his artistic skills,\nthe house ended up like this.\nWhat a change!\nAntony.\nHis usual pose for the camera is that.\nHolding the phone...\nIt still continues.\nNowadays, who has time to\npreserve photos in print?\nEverything is there in the phone, right?\nIt\'ll stay in the phone,\nbut not in the mind.\nIt\'s really nice, right? Seeing\nwhat I did, the neighbours started doing.\nBut what\'s the use?\nNone of them love the plants.\nWhen we care, nurture and love them,\nthey flower and bear fruits.\nSeeing it, I get a pleasure\nsimilar to giving birth.\nIsn\'t it so?\nReally nice, right? Let\'s also\nbuild a room like this.\nHold her.\nDid you find even\none photo of me in it?\nI didn\'t notice.\nThis has only photos of\nthe dad and sons, none of me.\nYou were busy running around.\nWhere was the time for clicking photos?\nThis house now runs thanks to\nthat running around.\nSome sprinter you\'re...\nWith a nurse at home, we didn\'t have to\nhire a home nurse for my dad.\nShe\'ll take care of everything.\nPoor thing...\nIt\'s not entirely me,\nPapa helps out once in a while.\nThere were no birthday parties today?\nAntony...\nPhone.\nFrom the bank?\nYes, the manager calls often\nto canvas for health insurance.\nPass me the salad.\nDon\'t fill yourself with this.\nThere\'s fried rice too.\n-Aunty\'s cooking is fabulous!\n-Thank you.\n-Please share this recipe with me.\n-Sure.\nI\'m planning to start a cooking channel.\nShe can\'t even make tea well.\nIt\'s OK, dear. Here\'s one.\nHe can\'t even plant spinach.\nStill, he\'s a big YouTuber.\n-Oh, Charles has a YouTube channel?\n-I haven\'t watched.\nNeither have we.\nStarted earning revenue?\nOf course, tons of it.\nHis account can\'t hold\nall the millions.\nIsn\'t it?\n[mumbling]\nCutlet for you?\nKeep it aside at least\nwhen you are eating.\nHe\'s on it all the time.\nHello...\nYes?\nI\'ll call you.\nCome immediately.\n-OK?\n-Can you call back?\nHey, come here.\nThere he is.\nOne second.\nI\'ll deal with these managers.\nDon\'t let anyone come there.\nEspecially that nasty baldy!\nSorry, it\'s my plate. I won\'t let\nanyone take it home. Give it.\nWho\'s that?\nPriya, get up and\nwash your hands.\nHi...\nWoke up, grandpa?\nDon\'t be afraid! We won\'t\nmake an author of you.\n-He doesn\'t say anything else?\n-After the accident, he sleeps less...\n...sorry speaks very less. Half of it\nis in English without head and tail.\nOne second. Tell me.\n-Please keep it there.\n-She is not listening to me.\nI get you. But the previous manager\napproved the loan based on your salary.\nResigning from your job and joining films\nis fraud in the eyes of the bank.\nMommy, Can we have a fish like this?\nWe\'ll buy today itself.\nAnything else?\nShe\'s like this. She doesn\'t\neven buy a puppy.\nAll moms are the same.\n-I\'ve been asking for ages.\n-You\'ll buy pets and go away.\nWe\'ll have to take care\nof its droppings.\nHave some more ice cream.\n-Come on, baby...\n-There he goes with the baby.\nHey, give the baby some ice cream.\nWe\'ll have it later.\nOh, here\'s your dad.\nOh dear, what happened?\nWhy are you crying?\nShall I pick you up?\nShe\'s cranky.\nHey, where is Antony?\nOver there, talking to someone.\n-Susan...\n-Yeah?\nThe problem is the EMI dues.\nI have a lot of pressure\nfrom the head office.\nIf you pay at least\nthe pending interest...\n...I\'ll be able to support you.\n-Hey, why are you here?\n-Papa, he\'s the new bank manager.\n-Hello.\n-Hi.\n-Please come in.\n-No, we\'re in a hurry.\nPlease have tea.\nNo, it\'s about to rain. Let\'s leave.\n-Who\'s that?\n-Well... Come here.\nThere\'s something...\nCome fast.\n-They\'re calling you, Papa.\n-You take care of them.\nOK. Bye.\nStart...\nSo all of you please go to Charlz...\n-What was the name?\n-Techy!\nSo all of you please go\nto Charlz Techy channel...\n-...and like, share, subscribe.\n-The gesture you showed is of dislike.\nPeople will do that.\nSay once more.\nI\'m not in the mood.\nPlease understand.\nOK, then.\nAlso... Pick up the calls.\nWe get anxious when you don\'t.\nOK?\nMust be health insurance...\nHe left?\nI got scared.\nWhether he\'ll create a ruckus\nabout the missed EMIs.\nWe\'ll start then.\nShall we?\nNow? Wait for the rain to stop.\nIt\'s thundering.\nThat\'s OK.\n-Should we wait for a bit?\n-Then let the rain let up.\nWonder when the power will be back.\nHe had promised to repair\nthe inverter himself,\nbut it never happened.\n-Did the water fall on her?\n-She got scared of the thunder.\n-The wind has brought the rain in.\n-Come on, sweetie.\nDear, move away from the window.\nCharles...\nCome down.\nHey, how many times have I told you\nnot to sit near the window with the phone?\nWhat\'s your problem, Papa?\nDon\'t you hear the thunder? Why can\'t you\nleave it aside for five minutes?\nSo what? I haven\'t\nconnected it anywhere.\nWon\'t it come through the radiation\nfrom the lightning?\nWhat radiation?\nWon\'t it come through the air?\nIt has internet, right?\nDon\'t make a laughing stock\nof yourself, Papa.\nIt\'s an addiction, right?\nIt\'s like smoking.\nHe can\'t keep it away\neven for five minutes.\nVishal has announced\nhis new movie.\n-Isn\'t this Antony\'s producer?\n-Let me have a look.\nIt\'s all due to this\nphone addiction.\nOtherwise he could have finished\nthe script and made the film.\nHe fights with Priya daily.\nHave you noticed them talking\nat least once today?\n-This is the reason.\n-Can you just stop it?\nYou\'re driving me crazy.\nI am wondering why I decided\nto come to this cursed home.\nYou all are the reason for this.\nRemember it\'s your stupidity\nI\'m paying for right now.\nAntony, please...\nWhat happened?\nEveryone\'s so gloomy...\nKuttiyamma would have said\nsomething stupid, right?\nHey guys...\nYes, we are both stupid.\nWe brought you up like this.\nThat\'s our biggest stupidity.\nWhat did I do to get scolded?\nWhy, can\'t I scold you?\nCan\'t I?\nThat man there is your father.\nKeep that in mind.\nWho are you two?\nKings come down from heaven?\nYou...\nShall we?\n-The rain hasn\'t let up.\n-Don\'t think it will...\nCall Susan.\nOK, then...\nWhy did they\nDisappear\nIn the moonlit night\nWhy in a corner\nOf the eye did\nThey stand wilted\nBy the side of the waiting flower\nMy tearful dreams\nDoes the sky sob after the rains\nWhen nobody watches\nWhy did they\nDisappear\nIn the moonlit night\nOh if only you were within reach\nThe distances have become flaming lamps\nLike waves of twinkling tears\nHave you faded away\nOh if only you were within reach\nThe distances have become flaming lamps\nUnseen\nDid you seek the edges of these fields?\nAs dark falls\nWon’t you rest in this beautiful nest?\nBeside my heart\nAs the story changes\nCome along, alone\nThere are thousands of\ninspiring stories out there.\nAmong those, what\'s the\nsignificance of my autobiography?\nMy life story was not unique.\nMy voice was not special.\nI told this to Annammachi once.\nIt was she who gave me the courage.\n"There\'s no one else like you.\nIf you don\'t express yourself..."\n"...if you don\'t explore who you are, then\nthe essence of you will be lost forever."\nAnd that was my inspiration.\nNot just the urge to write...\n...this beautiful cover you see here...\n...is also painted by my dear mom.\nNow you talk, Mommy.\nI haven\'t painted in a long time.\nThis was because he persisted.\nWhenever I take the brush in hand,\na face comes to my mind.\nThe face of God.\nThere was a day\nwhen God came to earth for me.\nOh, my God! Honey...\nRealising I can\'t even take him\nto the hospital...\n...I decided to end my life.\nAs I walked back,\na hand stopped me, as if sent by God.\nWhy are you crying?\nHe said to my tired self,\n"Don\'t cry..."\n"Medical college? We\'ll go there."\nThose words brought me back to life.\nScared by his reckless actions\nto get us to the hospital...\n...I began to walk back.\nThen he told me something.\n"You don\'t need as much courage\nto get on to this,\nas you need to watch your son die."\nAfter I admitted Joseph, I couldn\'t find\nthat kid and the others who came.\nHe came to rescue from somewhere\nlike God, and disappeared.\nI searched a lot, but\ncouldn\'t find that boy.\nHow long can I search for\nsomeone anonymous?\nI often think...\nWhy did he risk his own life\nto help total strangers like us?\nWhen I paint something for his\nautobiography, what else will I show?\nThere were a lot of hindrances\nto go to the hospital.\nNo vehicle.
