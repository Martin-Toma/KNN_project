That's why I watched this movie with special interest. I liked the way the film makers handled the opening scene of the movie. The camera was inside the wagon following the stagecoach. The sound of the horses hooves clattering on the pavement and the dust blowing around the horses added to the realism of the action. The scenes of the Native Americans riding bareback were convincing, especially the way they rode in unison. The scene of the attack on the bank robbers was exciting.
