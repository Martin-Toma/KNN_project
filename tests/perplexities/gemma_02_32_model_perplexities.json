This movie covers the topic of Hart Island and gives us insight into the reasons for burying people in a mass grave instead of a traditional cemetery.br br The documentary focuses on the experiences of individuals and staff at the cemetery while addressing the ethical aspects of the practice. As stated in the synopsis, the film explores the historical context surrounding the creation of the cemetery, the significance of the mass grave system itself, and the treatment of the deceased. It goes beyond the controversy regarding the disposal method and sheds light on the difficulties faced by the workers and volunteers who manage the cemetery. They work tirelessly to ensure that the deceased receive appropriate honors regardless of their socioeconomic status. The film provides a compassionate portrait of the people responsible for maintaining the cemetery while showcasing the challenges they encounter. The film offers a fresh perspective on an issue that has been discussed for decades. For example, the use of mass graves for the mentally ill and impoverished may seem extreme and insensitive to contemporary viewers, but the filmmakers explain that this practice dates back to ancient Egypt and was adopted by the Greeks and Romans. The film delves deeper into the practices employed throughout history and underscores the importance of understanding past practices in order to grasp current perspectives. The film serves as a reminder of the tragic consequences of neglecting mental health patients, the homeless, and the impoverished.br br Although this documentary contains mature themes including discussions of mental illness, substance abuse, homelessness, and death, it delivers essential information about the topic. The film is well produced, edited, and directed. Its portrayal of the cemetery workers demonstrates the dedication required to uphold this noble mission. The film raises thoughtful points about the ethics of treating human remains as commodities, questioning the efficacy of treating the destitute and mentally ill as disposable. In conclusion, the film presents a thoughtprovoking exploration of a topic that is often overlooked. The movie includes a substantial amount of relevant material and is accessible for both casual and serious viewers. Recommended.\"  \n}"
