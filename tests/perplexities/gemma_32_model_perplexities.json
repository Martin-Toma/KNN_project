This is the best documentary I have ever seen, and I am a feminist, but this film puts feminism in perspective. It shows how feminism has led to a culture that ignores basic common decency towards women. The film is also critical of the women who push feminism, especially the women in the mainstream media. These women are so busy telling everyone how bad men are that they forget to mention the evil that women inflict on each other. For example, there is an interview with Gloria Steinem, and she talks about how feminist men are not treated fairly. What about the millions of men who are abused daily by feminist women? Why don't feminists include those men in their narratives?br br The film is a thoughtful expose that will make anyone rethink what feminism is all about. It is not about hating men; it is about being independent.\"  \n}"
