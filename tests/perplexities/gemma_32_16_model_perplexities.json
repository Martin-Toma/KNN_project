An interesting side note - In 1985, I was a member of the Federal Witness Protection Program and worked closely with Salvatore Montella aka Sammy Gravano. I recall Sammy telling me about the making of this film and the involvement of his fellow prisoner Carmine Carano, whom I interviewed for the documentary 'Mafia Inc'. Sammy also mentioned that the film depicted his late sister Anna Mae Flickinger as a Mafia assassin, which she was not. However, since I worked for the FBI, I was not aware of the truth regarding the film. Despite that, the film is highly entertaining and portrays the character of the Mafia, the culture of New York City and the criminal element quite accurately.\"  \n}"

He fails, returns to 2011, and finds his girlfriend killed by a zombi.br br The problem is that Tallahassee's plan fails for two reasons, namely:br br 1. The book depository building is under renovation during the date of the attempted assassination. Therefore, there is no way that he could have gotten to the roof and fired the shots.br br 2. Even if he had managed to kill Kennedy, it wouldn't have changed the outcome of history, because the event that caused the Cuban Missile Crisis to occur would still happen, thus resulting in nuclear war, and therefore World War III.br br Because of this, Tallahassee is unable to rescue his girlfriend, and the film ends in defeat.br br Now, there are several ways to fix the ending. One would be to have Tallahassee travel back to 1961, and attempt to kill Oswald at the Dallas Fair Park Shooting Range. This would allow him to kill Oswald and Kennedy, thereby changing the outcome of events.br br Another possibility is to have Tallahassee travel back to 1960 and assassinate Castro prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion. This would prevent Cuba from becoming communist, which would lead to Khrushchev installing missiles in Cuba, the U.S. reacting, causing the Cuban Missile Crisis, and ultimately leading to World War III.br br As you can see, there are many possibilities as to how Tallahassee could change the outcomes of history. The ending is simply unsatisfactory and poorly written, and requires fixing, otherwise it is just an incomplete, and unsatisfying movie.br br I highly recommend this film, regardless of my criticisms, but there is room for improvement, and the filmmakers have to decide whether or not to implement one of the suggestions above.\"  \n}"
