This is one of the few films from the period that retains its freshness. The actors are all excellent, especially Jeanne Summers, and the plot follows the classic pattern of the musical genre. The movie was shot on location, in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Jackson, Mississippi. It was filmed mostly outdoors, giving the impression that the action takes place in the countryside instead of a studio.br br There are 10 different sequences, including the opening title sequence in which we learn that Blossom and Chiquita Hart are the stars of the show. Chiquita is a tap dancer while Blossom is a Southern belle who sings and dances. Their father, Harry, is a famous Dixieland musician. The two sisters are orphans and have moved from town to town, performing in vaudeville shows. In addition to the performances, there are several dance numbers featuring the ensemble cast, including a Cajun dance, a Charleston, and a ballet. The ending is a traditional wedding scene.br br Musical numbers include the original version of Cotton Blossom, a duet sung by Blossom and Chiquita, and an adaptation of I Wish I Knew How to Swing. The Cotton Blossom number opens with a large production number that contains the entire score. Other featured songs include I Got a Girl, If You Know Your Thing, and Blue Rhythm Blues. The movie ends with an alternate version of the finale, called Night and Day, which replaces Cotton Blossom with a chorus line of sailors and dock workers.br br Although the plotline is predictable, the acting is enjoyable, especially Betty Talbot as the mother, Jeanette Nolan as the grandmother, and Kay Thompson as the youngest sister, who plays a comic relief role. Recommended for fans of 1950's musicals.\"  \n}"

The premise is interesting and compelling. However, it suffers from lack of context and depth.br br For example, it is unclear why the author chose to target impoverished rural communities. The school districts chosen are all small and remote, but not in rural areas. The author makes no mention of urban poverty, inner city crime, gangs, or child abuse. The assumption is that the students come from rural farms and are generally in need of discipline.br br Also, the film fails to establish the necessary contrast required to effectively communicate the magnitude of the problem. For example, it mentions that the South Dakota dropout rate is 30%. That is a relatively low rate compared to the national average of 25%, and the world average of 17%.br br Additionally, there is no comparison to the cost of providing universal vouchers to all students in the U.S. Instead, the film focuses on the costs of the programs discussed. We are never told the total budget for K12 education in the United States. We are told that the cost of the programs featured ranges from 1,800 to 80,000 dollars. Again, no comparisons to total expenditure.br br Finally, the film presents no evidence that the programs are working. It relies solely on anecdotes and individual testimonials. To be honest, I did not find the testimonies convincing. Perhaps it would have helped to provide more background information on the participants, such as socioeconomic status, family structure, attendance, etc.br br The authors intentions are noble, and I respect that, but unfortunately, this film lacks the credibility to justify the proposed solutions.
