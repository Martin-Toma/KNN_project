One such element is the idea that the film industry is not dying; it is transforming itself. Examples of this transformation include the emergence of nonunion actors in French films and the increasing use of digital technology in filmmaking. Additionally, the rise of streaming services, particularly in France, has allowed smaller budget films to reach far wider audiences.

This movie follows Albus Scamander as he attempts to solve an ancient murder mystery involving a man named Professor Cornelius Scullard. Scullard was a respected member of the Order of the Phoenix and a valued colleague of Albus Scamander. Unfortunately, the events leading to the murder of Scullard began to occur when Voldemort broke through the Veil of Death and entered the Muggle World. As a result of this breach, the balance of power between the magical and nonmagical worlds shifted. The Minister of Magic, Cornelius Scullard, and his allies attempted to put a stop to the carnage by creating an alliance with the Order of the Phoenix, however, Voldemort learned of this plan and captured the ministers and their families. With the death of the ministers and members of the Order of the Phoenix, the balance of power tipped further towards Voldemort. After finding clues that led to the death of Scullard, Scamander joined forces with the magical community in an effort to restore the balance of power. While attempting to uncover the identity of the murderer, the plot thickens when Scullard's daughter, Bellatrix Lestrange, disappears.

But if you haven't seen the original, it does not detract from the quality of the film. Of course, the director did a wonderful job with making a new story. As far as acting goes, David Stern has great chemistry with the actress. I think he is a better actor than Rob Schneider. At least he doesn't look so fake when he speaks. There are several subplots which add interest to the film. However, the plot itself is weak and illogical. In fact, the whole ending is ridiculous. Not to spoil it for you, but, the main character discovers the terrorist group responsible for the murders, but also he is the leader of the gang. They are not terrorists at all. Then why do they try to kill him? And why would they torture him? To answer that question, you must see the film to find out. The cinematography is well done. However, there is no soundtrack, which is a major drawback. The actors perform admirably, considering their limited dialogue. The actors give a superb performance in the scenes where they actually speak. I recommend this film highly. Enjoy.\"  \n}",
