They signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which stated that each signatory would not transfer nuclear weapons or technology to any non-signatory countries. In return for this pledge, each signatory was guaranteed military protection by the others in case of an attack.br br In 1966, Soviet ships violated the treaty by firing at American warships off Alaska. The United States retaliated by launching a preemptive first strike against the Soviets. Although there were no casualties, it left America with a serious credibility gap. It had been caught off guard, so to speak, and had lost its ability to initiate a counterstrike in time. As a result, President Foster decides to change his policy regarding Russian aggression. He orders a surprise attack, code-named Slam Dunk, to be launched within 72 hours. But the operation leaks out into the press, leading to a coup attempt by members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who are opposed to the plan.br br With less than two days before the deadline, the president must decide whether to order the attack or abandon it. This film presents two scenarios, both of them equally possible, as they occur during the first few days of the year 1966. The director was unable to determine which scenario he considered more likely, but chose to present them both.

The movie contains scenes of actual events that occurred during the Battle of Guadalcanal. During the early stages of the Pacific Campaign, US Forces launched numerous attacks on occupied islands. Many failed and the losses proved high. After several failed attempts, American troops were able to capture the island of Guadalcanal. The film concentrates primarily on the Naval Support Battalion stationed on the island. The Seabees were instrumental in building and maintaining air fields, runways, and seaports, clearing jungles of vegetation, digging trenches and tunnels, laying communications cables and pipes, erecting piers, and constructing bridges. Although the Seabees were not Marines, they worked closely with Marine forces. The U.S. Navy also played a critical role during the campaign. The Imperial Japanese navy opposed the invasion of Guadalcanal. Although vastly inferior numerically, the Japanese navy attempted to prevent the invasion of the island. At first, the Japanese navy concentrated on mining the entrance to the harbor. The U.S. Military Intelligence Directorate was aware of this strategy and planned accordingly. As the invasion approached, the U.S. Navy placed submarines and mines in position to sink the Japanese ships. While operating in the region, the submarine USS Starfish sank nine Japanese cruisers and damaged several others. A fleet of warships including carriers, escorts, and support ships were positioned to provide naval gunfire covering the amphibious assault. The film accurately depicts the hardships endured by the men, including lack of adequate medical supplies, insufficient rations, and inadequate weapons.
