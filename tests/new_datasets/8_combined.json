I remember watching it in the theater during its initial release. The story revolves around a legendary gunman named Wild Bill Hickok, played by Gary Cooper. As a seasoned veteran of the wild frontier, Hickok gained fame for his marksmanship and daring deeds. However, his reputation was tainted due to a fatal gunshot wound sustained by lawmen after a shootout. Despite being considered a hero in some circles, Hickok eventually became a victim of circumstance. The film delves into the complex character of Hickok, exploring the moral ambiguity surrounding his actions and legacy. It portrays the harsh reality of life on the frontier and the consequences faced by individuals caught in the crossfire of conflicting ideologies. Overall, 'Badman' provides a compelling examination of American history through the lens of Western mythology and legend.
