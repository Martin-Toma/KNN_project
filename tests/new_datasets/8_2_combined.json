In addition, I suggest adding information on the schools Mr. Duffy attended, such as Kendall College, Johnson & Wales University, and Le Cordon Bleu, among others.

There are a couple scenes of gunplay that are particularly exciting. However, the script does suffer from some flaws, such as a fairly predictable ending.
