We miss you!\nWe're about to get on the plane!\nIt's weird being here without you!\nBest wishes.\nJust move to Copenhagen with me.\nWhy wouldn't you?\nYou don't even have space\nfor your couch in that apartment.\nOh, come on. That's a terrible reason.\nOf course there's space.\nYou'd go crazy having me and\nmy stupid leg around all the time.\n- Plus, you'll be studying all day.\n- You'd find something to do too.\nSuch as? I have no qualifications.\nIt's so frustrating. I trained for\nsix years, and it was all for nothing.\nHEDEGAARD, DENMARK\nThat was out! That one was out.\n- It was not, Grandpa.\n- You're cheating.\nDaniel, will you be the referee?\nSure. It was totally out.\n- What?\n- Yes!\n- Maybe he'll go back to school.\n- He wants to be a photographer.\n- It's something he's always wanted.\n- It won't earn him a living, Mom.\nWhy are you always so mad at Daniel?\nI'm not mad at anyone. But you're not\ndoing him any favors by coddling him.\nHe's 23, isn't he?\nDoes he even pay you rent?\nYes, he pays 80,000 kroner a month\nplus utilities, Anita.\n- I paid to live here when I turned 18.\n- Daniel doesn't get student grants.\nThat's right. You don't get that when\nyou do cartwheels instead of studying.\nShut up. You're so annoying.\n- Would you set the table?\n- Nope.\nGreat!\n- Did you look into photography schools?\n- No. It doesn't pay to go to school.\nYou're too good already?\nNo, but an apprenticeship\nwould be better.\n- More ham, anyone?\n- Yes, please.\n- You'll have to watch your diet now.\n- As if you've ever done that.\n- Don't be cheeky. I'm just saying.\n- Thanks, Dad. That's great advice.\nI'm here for you any time.\nHow many photographers did you call?\n- Just get off my ass, Anita.\n- Don't talk to me like that.\nSo stop. You know there are\nno photographers around here.\n- \"Get off my ass...\"\n- Stop! We don't talk like that.\n- Stop.\n- I won't have it.\nWhat about going to Aarhus?\nOr is that too far for His Majesty?\n- Cut it out, Anita.\n- Mom does everything for you two.\nAnd now she'll be waiting on him\nhand and foot for another year.\nOh, shut up. How about trying\nyour luck on farmerdating.com?\n- Hilarious.\n- Or find a plumber to clean your pipes?\nYou're hilarious.\nIf you really want to know, I plan on\nmoving to Copenhagen with Signe.\n- To Copenhagen?\n- Yeah.\nTake care.\nCan you grab this one too?\nAnd this one. Here you go.\nI'll get this one.\nWhen you're done studying, we'll find\nwork, get married and have kids.\nWe'll find a bigger place and buy a new\ncar every four years like your parents.\nWe'll go on vacations and do our thing\nuntil we retire and die.\nWell, it sure sucks\nwhen you say it like that.\n- But that's how it is.\n- Of course it is.\nAnd that's totally sad.\nHello?\n- How did you get in?\n- The door was open.\nI'm Daniel Rye. I'm interviewing\nfor the job as photo assistant.\nIt's just that we had an appointment\nand all the other places I went...\nShow me your portfolio.\nYeah.\nYour portraits are boring as hell, but\nyour street photographs have something.\nRight. Well, I do actually prefer...\n- Do you have a passport?\n- Yeah.\n- Sorry?\n- It's unnatural, a flying pile of iron.\nRight.\nAre you all right?\nYeah.\nThey're so young, just boys.\nIn terms of war they're veterans.\nWe've only paid half up front -\n- so if we don't survive,\nat least we'll save some money.\n- Where do you want this?\n- Wherever. Go shoot some pictures.\nThis is what\nI want to do my whole life, Signe.\n- I'm more certain than I've ever been.\n- Okay.\nHow drunk are you?\nI'm not. Well, maybe I'm moderately\nintoxicated, but I know this is it.\n- Sleep it off and come back home.\n- Right. Love you.\nIt's important to show people\nwhat's going on there.\n- Syria?\n- Yes.\nI'll document how\ncivilians live amid the conflict.\nEveryday lives\nthat keep going despite the war.\n- It's dangerous.\n- I'm not going to Aleppo.\nI'll go to a small town near the border.\nIt's far away from the fighting.\n- What does your boss say?\n- He's letting me take time off.\nThis is my idea.\nI won't stay in the same place too long\nand I'll go back to Turkey every night.\nThat's where I'll sleep.\nLike the reporters I've talked to.\nI just need a little extra money\nfor the flight and the hotel.\n- So maybe you could buy the Taunus?\n- You're selling your car?\nIt's just collecting parking tickets\nin Copenhagen.\n- How will you come to visit us?\n- Mom.\nDaniel, I don't know.\nWhat do you think, Kjeld?\nWell...\nWhat did you expect to get for it?\nWell, 20,000... or 18,000?\nIt's not even worth 10,000.\nThe undercarriage is rusty.\nJust buy the damn car.\nHow about 15,000?\n14,000.\nCome on, Dad.\nI'll give you 12,000 kroner\nif you fill up the tank.\n- I'll pay for the gas.\n- Jeez...\n- Deal.\n- What a haggler.\n{\\an8}BAB AL-SALAMEH, SYRIA\nHello.\nDo you mind if we take some pictures?\n- What are you doing here?\n- He's a photographer.\nYou have no authorization.

It's not overly complicated, but it's a masterful example of how to make cinema out of few words, silences, and small actions. It's an existentialist masterpiece.br br The performances are perfect. Nathalie Baye plays a woman who is lonely and searching for fulfillment. She's trapped in her life, and the film explores her inner turmoil, both physically and emotionally. Her character also has a haunting quality. She is vulnerable and fragile, but also strongwilled.br br Bernard Giraudeau is equally superb as a man whose feelings for Baye's character are more than platonic. He plays a man who seems a bit lost himself, but is happy to be around her. Their chemistry together is amazing.

Lee Ray Oliver, to death by lethal injection. Is there anything you'd like to say? Fuck you! Fuck every last one of you! Fuck you! Cover that up, please. Let's get the bag open. Thank you. - Where am I? - You're in the County Morgue. I'm not dead. The injections you got were all saltwater except the anesthetic. - What the fuck is going on? - You're getting an opportunity... to be part of a medical research project. If you agree to participate in the experiment... I'll take you toe tag here put it on that body over there. He'll be cremated, you'll go on with these gentlemen. If you don't agree the doctor will inject you with sodium pentathol... and the execution will proceed right now in this room. What kind of experiment? It's a behaviour modifying drug trial. - Who the fuck are you? - I'm a neuropharmacologist. I'm involved in the research and development of new drugs. - I like drugs! - The drug we're going to give you... is not a narcotic. It won't give you narcotic sensations. And there may be side effects. Some severe, possibly fatal. - You want me to be a guinea pig? - No, you'll be a test subject. You have 1 minute to make your decision. Fuck you, Warden! Proceed. This is your last chance to do something good in your life. A chance to give something back to society. Fuck society! What the fuck has society ever done for me? Doctor! Just wait! Wherever we're going I hope it smells better that it did in there. Let's go. You greedy fuck! So now you see how it goes. Every time I say fuck... he does that! Because you, Warden... have a lot of fucking nerve! You thought you're gonna get another one, didn't you? But I said fucking, not fuck. - Please, stop! - Didn't I pay you well... to let my men go after Lee Ray in prison? When Lee Ray offered him instead, did I complain? No. I didn't give a flying fuck! I found out the State was gonna execute him. So I am satisfied. But now you tell me that Lee Ray is actually alive... and that you will find out where he is... if I pay you? I'm sorry, I'll do it for free. It's fair! You'll find him, and we'll kill him. Third time's the charm, right? Yes, Mr. Vertov. Third time's the... Don't fuck up! You'll start off by taking one pill every six hours. Wait a fucking minute! Wait a minute. What's this pill gonna do? My name is Dr. Copeland. I designed the medication you'll be taking. It's called Anagress. It works by altering the brain's chemistry... by suppressing your violent tendencies. And with you aggression reduced... you'll begin to experience feelings of good will and compassion... a sense of right and wrong, even remorse over past mistakes. - Good fucking luck. - This is the first time Anagress... has been tried on humans. We don't know what the side effects are. Hopefully they're minor: Dry mouth, dizziness, nausea... but there is a chance they could be more severe. Like what? Liver failure, brain seizures... ...a stroke... - Whatever. Years ago, they might have given you a lobotomy... carved out a piece of your brain like a rotten part of an apple. But today we're more civilized. We do it biochemically. I rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy! How long is your little experiment gonna last? It's never over. You and the other 19 test subjects... will be observed indefinitely. That' one pill every six hours. Open wide. Let's go. Open back up. Smart man. - Hey, Michael! How you doing? - Good. I'm doing good. Excellent. Is that Austin? He scored two goals in the first half. - He's getting real tall. - They grow up so fast, don't they? Ah, jeez! I just came to see how the team was doing. We're doing good. - It's not the same, but... - No. Nothing is. Yes! The guy seems a real teddy bear. Two days and not a peep. I want blood, urine and saliva samples. I have a PET scan and SPECT scheduled. Add a cerebral spinal fluid analysis. Yes, doctor. Mr. Oliver... we're going to remove your last restraint. {y:i}Iwant you to relax. I just died and live to talk about it. {y:i}It doesn't get more {y:i}relaxed than this. Is it all right if I smoke in here? {y:i}We have a security breach. {y:i}I repeat, {y:i}we have a security breach. Go! We got him! - The man is a fucking animal. - He's perfect! Hey, Aiku! {y:i}- Shit! {y:i}- Zone 8 activated. {y:i}- Zone 8 activated. - Aiku! - Hello. - There you are! I've been looking for you everywhere. You've changed the code again. I'm sorry. We agreed you were gonna call before you came by. It's my weekend. You knew I was coming by. - I forgot. I'm sorry. - How unusual! Hello, Aiku! How are you? - What happened? You look terrible! - It was a rough day at the office. You look terrific, by the way. I got a call from Jenny. She said you showed up at the soccer match. - That was fast! - She was worried about you. And I'm worried about you too. I just wanted do feel what it was like to... be there again. - I hurt too, you know. - I know. - That's why I've gotta go. - I know that too. Come on. Time to go to mom's house. Next time I call before I come. - All right. - Come on! You never told me your ex was so beautiful. - How long have you been here? - Not long. I was just in the pool and I saw her drive up. It wouldn't be a brilliant idea for me to be toweling off in the living room. I went upstairs and hid in your closet. How's your jaw? The truth? - I'm gonna make you feel better. - Make me forget everything. Can you do that for me? I can try. - What the hell is going on? - Take the pill first. Where's my hair? Where's my tattoos? Erased. Like your past. In the next few weeks we'll be making changes on your outside... while the medication changes you on the inside. After what you guys did to me, you guys should be taking these pills! OK, but you first. Attaboy. The guy is pretty good. Beat my high score. Seratonine metabolate levels? Barely registering. The guy is a textbook sociopath. Is it true he stabbed an inmate in the eye with a screwdriver? Yes. He goes for the head. - Increase game difficulty. - Ok. Let's crank it up to mach 5. - How'd he do with his MMPI? - Just what you'd expect from... a guy with antisocial personality disorder... ...with psychotic tendencies. - And that's just for starters. Your fucking thing is rigged! {y:i}You can't hit a thing! Fuck! This fucking thing is rigged! Get the fuck... Get the fuck... thing is rigged! This thing is fucked up! It's a broken machine! Get the fuck outta here! Fix your fucking machine! There goes 1O grand. Take it out of my paycheck. Nikolai Vertov. 27 years old. Do you ever feel bad about taking his life? - Bad? I feel really bad. - You do? Tell me. If I'd known the motherfucker was the nephew of a Russian mobster... I never would've robbed him, let alone put a bullet through his head. Manoel Jose Gutierrez. - You ever been in prison, Doc? - Let's not get distracted. I didn't think so. It's probably not what you're exactly used to. The Russian mobster took a contract out on me for killing his nephew. Gutierrez here tried to cash in on that contract. I just defended myself. - You felt justified in... - I felt fucking justified! I don't give a fuck if you believe me or not! That's what happened. I got the jump on him, he's dead, I'm alive. Gary David Caputo. We got a minor bump. He's alive. - Just a little worse for wear. - Tell me what happened with him. Just wrong place, wrong time. It's not my problem. You threatened to kill his brother for testifying at the trial. - Is that true? - Are we done? This is getting boring. You were 12 years old when your mother died? - You know exactly how old I was! - These files have discrepancies. I just wanna make sure I get it right. A former boyfriend killed her... and you witnessed the murder. Is that true? Just give me the drugs and let's get on with it. You never said anything about answering any of these questions! - Just answer the question. - I'll answer whatever I want! And don't you go talking to me like that\nmodel\n{\"rating\": 4.6, \"genres\": [\"Crime\", \"Drama\"], \"review\": \"{'text': \\\"A very interesting movie.

The acting is decent, the storyline is reasonable and the special effects were quite good. However, there were some issues that bothered me. One thing was that this movie felt very slow paced and plodding. It takes awhile to get going, which is why I knocked off one star.br br Secondly, while the killer is called The Tall Man, he does not appear until fairly late into the movie. Most of the movie follows two friends who have a peculiar knack for digging up corpses. They discover bodies in their graveyard, which is actually a hoax designed by their grandfather. The body parts are then used to make Frankensteinesque monsters.br br Thirdly, even though the movie is called The Tall Man, the character spends most of the movie hiding under trees and behind bushes and never appears in anything resembling a menacing manner. While this may be a fun homage to the Universal monster movies of the 30s and 40s, I wish the studio would have made better use of the title.br br Despite these minor quibbles, I still recommend The Tall Man to fans of horror movies.",

My little boy, he loves the countryside, loves it. All the fresh air, animals and that. \"Aminals\" he calls them. Yeah, aminals. Right... Hands. - Gumbell. - Thanks, sir. That's nice. It's from Julie. Oh, right. # There is nothing you can name that is anything like... # - Sir. - Carry on. AC0027 Hands, sir. - On your feet, Hands. - \"Stand up, Hands\" works better. This is Mr Mortimer, the Governor. You get into trouble very quickly. You arrive from Wormwood Scrubs, 5pm, at half past, you're in the block. The film never did it justice. South Pacific, the musical. I heard you singing Nothin' Like a Dame. You know... Mitzi Gaynor. Nowhere near as good as Stella Budd. - Stella Budd? - In South Pacific. My dad had the original soundtrack recording. South Pacific. Very impressive. Thank you... sir. You'll find this less than impressive, sir. \"March 1982, on probation for car theft.\" \"June '84, six months.\" \"Attempted hold-up of a... hot-dog stand.\" \"July '88, betting shop. March '91, jewellers.\" \"Now, five years into a 12-year sentence for armed bank robbery.\" This doesn't make happy reading, Hands. Remember, one knife, one fork, one spoon. - That's it? - That's it. I like a challenge. Guscott will show you what to do. Hello, Rudy. Sorry. Sorry about this. - It's fine. - Sorry. Sorry. Stop apologising will you, you freak? S-Sorry. AC0027 Hands. Thanks. Annabel Sweep. Welcome to the prisoner support unit. You must be one of these do-gooders. That's me. Come to help unfortunates get back on the straight and narrow? Nothing gets past you. You must be of those master criminal types. Bank robber. Bank robber. Wait till I tell my friends. They'll be impressed. We are considered elite criminals. Is that why you became a bank robber? To impress women? That was a by-product. OK, then. I'll explain something to you, Jimmy. Nine out of the ten prisoners I meet get out, screw up and are back inside within six months. It's my job to help you break that cycle. Right. I suggest that you attend some of our Addressing Offending Behaviour courses. We need to define the problem, Lenny. Tell me what you think the problem is, Darren. You are watching Gardener's World, Lenny. It's about tomatoes, Darren. But I want to watch London's Burning, it's about a fire in a school, Lenny. Let's discuss our problem more, Darren. I'm sure we can reach a compromise. - You'd really say that, Lenny? - No! No, I'd say... Let's maximise... Let's generate alternatives. Good. Do you have any particular alternatives in mind? Oh, yes. I have a question, Annabel. Welcome to Anger Management. If there's a certain someone who's got all this anger that he can't get rid of, that's bad for that someone, right? Your point being? Wouldn't it be better for that person to... forgive and forget? Well, if there is to be closure... - Closure! Ha! - Closure. You left me, Jimmy. Turned around, walked away, didn't look back. You abandoned me, mate. After all we'd been to each other. Point of information. We're talking money, bank, robbery. Oh! - Oi, I got captured! - We all got captured. That's why we're in prison. Sit down, please. Thank you. I got 12 years, James. I lost my flat... I lost my job, I lost my woman. - What about the motor? - Nah, a mate's got it. - Oh, good. - No, it's not good. It's bad. You never leave your mates behind, right? It's a rule, it's in the Bible! It is rather a breach of the old code. Anyone friggin' run out on me, they'd never do it again. You left me in the bank, James. You blew the job, Rudy, not me. What do you mean, you dickhead? Enough, enough, enough! Now, sit down, all of you! - I said sit down, Hands. Thank you, gentlemen. Right. What we all forgot to do then... was to \"define the problem\". The problem is Rudy... Jimmy Hands only cares about Jimmy bloody Hands! Has anyone ever got out of here? It's just a question! Who do you think you are, Steve McQueen? No. No one's gone over the wall in years. I could, though... if I felt like it. Yeah, of course you could. How? How am I gonna tell you that when I am not talking to you? OK, OK. But this is gonna take men with balls, Jimmy, real balls. There's no way to get out of any of the wings, they're all double-locked. And there's two fences before you even get to the wall. - Promising so far! - Now... what you do is, you get into the old chapel. What?! Come here. Come here! OK, that there. That is the weak link. They don't use it any more cos of the riots. It's all falling down, it's got minimum security. Break out of the old chapel, and there's just ONE fence between you and the wall. Yeah, but you have to get into the old chapel first. Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy! You can get anywhere you want when you are carrying a shooter. - A shooter? - They get smuggled in. You get out that gate, through the fence and blow the wall. - Blow the wall?! - With jelly. Boom! Boom? OK, just so as I'm clear... A bomb's gone off, we're standing in a pile of rubble, in the middle of nowhere... No, Rudy, it's a good plan. It's good, it's good. - Come in! Excuse me, sir. AC0027 Hands. This is terrible, Hands. You have been with us less than three weeks and you've spent all but two days in solitary. Tragic. Tragic. Wonderful actress, tragic life. - Sir? - Stella Budd. Ah. Your love of musical theatre must have given you something to fall back on when you were in solitary. Don't know where the time went, sir. You're very fortunate. Most of the men don't have that.

The movie also includes cameos by Robert Montgomery, Joan Leslie, Charles Laughton and others.br br The movie begins with Kay Francis leading a USO troupe across the English Channel, to entertain the troops. They travel by train to their destination, only to find the roads blocked by a huge traffic jam. After taking a wrong turn, they end up on a dirt road, leading them to a small town. They quickly realize that they've arrived in Germany during World War II. As they try to find their way to their next destination, they become involved in various adventures, such as assisting an injured German soldier, helping an orphaned child, and entertaining the Allied troops. Along the way, they discover that sometimes the enemy might not be as bad as they appear, and that war is not always black and white.br br The plot sounds simple enough, but the movie manages to keep viewers entertained throughout. The story is humorous and heartwarming, and offers plenty of opportunities for musical numbers. Many of the songs are classics, such as Sentimental Journey, Moonlight Serenade and Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree. The cast is excellent, and delivers strong performances.br br Overall, this movie is a fun and enjoyable watch. While it may not be perfect, it definitely earns its five star rating.",

He said, \"Tell Ellie I love her.\" Well ... you're a bad liar, but ... thank you anyway. - Wait a second. I saw something that night. I don't know. Your father came into the hospital. He ... I thought he was crazy, out of his mind. He's hangin' on to a Halloween mask. He wouldn't let it go. And what he said was... \"They're gonna kill us all.\" And in a little while, he was dead. And I don't know what the hell is goin' on. Papa really loved this place ... But business was getting bad. I suppose you shopped at the new mall like everybody else, huh?

This film is well made, but it is also one of those movies that does not hold your attention throughout.br br One of the main problems with this film is that Jimmy Stewart is miscast as a southern preacher. His character preaches against stealing and yet he steals from the local bank. Also, I believe that Stewart is not a Southern accent guy. It doesn't sound natural.br br As for Gene Tierney, she is fine. She plays a good role. However, the movie suffers from some really bad dialogue and direction.

Its a compelling story of an amazing man whose courage, conviction and determination made him an effective prosecutor. Although the mafia was strong in Italy at the time, this prosecutor managed to make progress against it. In addition to his professional accomplishments, Falcone also helped to improve working conditions for Sicilian farm workers. I liked seeing how this man overcame obstacles both in terms of his own physical disabilities and those posed by powerful forces determined to stop him from accomplishing his goals.br br The film features great performances by the cast including Toni Servillo, Roberto Farnese and Luigi Maria Burruano. I enjoyed watching their portrayals.br br If you are interested in true stories about real people overcoming incredible odds, watch this film.",

But, of course, there was intention on the prisoner's part. Deliberate and malicious intention. What happened, Tyler-- oversleep? Well, I weren't sure today was the day,Judge. I weren't sure. {y:i}The parole board's on the verge {y:i}of coming to some decision {y:i}about this boy of yours. Your wife's cousin, Braxton here... says he'll take him in, give him a job and t to set him straight. You got any opinion about that? It won't help none. I seen a might of trouble with this boy. He's as mean-tempered as they come. {y:i}- He'll drink, fish and read books. - Comics? - Beg pardon? - Does he read comic books? {y:i}Um, books, ma'am. {y:i}But there never was a hoe or plow made {y:i}that would fiit his hand. You're a damn liar, Pa. {y:i}[Judge ] I suggest you don't {y:i}say too much, boy. Your record's not good enough for you to make these rambunctious remarks. {y:i}Stole a car once, didn't you? {y:i}- Got picked up twice on a drunk charge. - I don't care, he's still lying. {y:i}I know why him and Hank {y:i}raise that corn. Both of'em drank my ma into an early grave with that corn. Glenn, how old were you when your mother died? - Ma'am? - She asked how old you were when your ma died. Almost nine. {y:i}Let's get on with this. {y:i}What's your recommendation, Phil? - I'd give him another chance, Tom. - So would I,Judge. On parole, of course. Have him report once a week. And I'd see to it he stayed decently at work with a living wage and board. I owe it to his mom, my own cousin, that much. He'll never do it, Rolfe. What he needs is correction. Mr. Tyler, what do you think needs improving in your son? Well, begging your pardon, what do you think don't? [ Laughing ] Your picture's a mighty black one, Sam. There was nothing wrong with this boy back a way. There was never a week come snow or rain... this boy and his mother didn't attend my church. Glenn, turn around, tellJudge Parker and the parole board... what was the master's c from the cross? {y:i}\"Eli, Eli, {y:i}lama sabachthani?\" And where in scripture is that noted? In Matthew 27:46... and sort of turned around in Mark 1 5:34. \"And what does,\" \" Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani\" \"mean?\" It means, \" My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" - Good luck, Glenn. - Thank you, sir. [ Whimpering ] Hello, Rosie. I'm glad the boy was paroled in his uncle's custody. That way, he'll have a chance. Tell me, was your sympathy for him real? You're the expert. You tell me. I know you both share the same kind of background. I identified with him. Isn't that the word? You're not in a hur, I'll buy you a drink. {y:i}- Or better still, make you one. - Not today, Phil. Irene, is it really never? {y:i}- Never again? - We both agreed to that. No, you agreed. I merely went along unwillingly. I'm sorry now I did. There aren't many times when a man's life is given real distinction. - Back to your law office, Mr. Macy. - All right, Mrs. Speery. {y:i}[ Train Passing ] Well, here we are. It don't look like much, but we serve a community need. Here's your new home, boy. These bottles are all ready for labelin'. Here's one that's a little short. Watch this, boy. [ Spits ] Mmm, good stuff. You gotta give 'em all a square measure. There. Now. All set to go. Suppose it's Johnson and Ter. They'll order under their own label. That's Shenandoah Elixir. That's this one right here. Mine's Old Seminole Tonic. Sold in every state in Dixie. Salem Drugs, they'll order under their own label too. That's on the end. - It's all the same stuff? - Yeah, all the same, 'cept for the labels and color. Eighty-seven percent aqua pure, thirteen percent grain alcohol. Some folks won't want a label at all. Just walk in off the street, buy a few at a time. [ Laughing ] Well, that's it, boy. - Are these the ones to be shipped? - Yep, first thing tomorrow. Here's the keys to the pickup truck. You'll be comfortable in here, Glenn. Had it fixed up special. {y:i}Clean, dry, healthy. {y:i}You even got your own {y:i}private entrance. {y:i}Better than I ever had {y:i}when I was a boy your age. I plan to put you in a shower right over yonder. [ Inhales ] I do love the smell of this place. D cardboard, alcohol, herbs. Also money. It just rolls in. - That's a good smell too. - About my pay, Uncle Rolfe. {y:i}- Okay to ask? - Pa, supper's ready. Fine, Norrie. Hope you made plenty. Got a good young appetite in the house now. Come and get it, Glenn, before she throws it out. Excuse me. - Mighty nice chandelier. Set me back a pretty penny too. {y:i}- [ Baby Crying ] - But cheap at the price. Sit down, Glenn. - All right. Yeah, mighty nice chandelier. Bought it off the old Johnson place. {y:i}- Renaissance style, they call it. {y:i}- Yes, mighty nice. Always spend your money with a purpose, boy. You'll usually find my advice is worth the heedin'. You got good Braxton blood in ya. I aim to see you get ahead. About my pay, Uncle Rolfe. For what we are about to receive... {y:i}may the Lord make us {y:i}truly grateful. Uh... my pay? Pay? Ten a week and keeps. Did I say ten? Well, 1 2.50's more like it. I want you happy, boy. We got a right pleasant little family here, and I want to keep it that way. Yeah. {y:i}[ Woman ] Glenn? Glenn? - Betty Lee. - Hello. Didn't expect to see you around. I drove in with Ma for the hospital fund meeting. - We'd hoped you'd be out for supper. - Nah, your kin don't like me. - That's not true. My ma thinks-- - Yeah, your ma! It's your pa. {y:i}[ Baby Crying ] - Is that Norrie's baby? - Well, it ain't a cat. - Did you see him, Glenn? What's he like? - What's a baby like? - Don't be mean. - What do you wanna ask so many questions for? They been at me all week with questions and more questions. I'm sor. I hadn't thought. They got me on parole. I gotta go up and see this parole officer once a week. Then I gotta get examined by this Miss Speery-- case worker, psychiat, whatever she is. She thinks she's got a lunatic on her hands. Irene Speery? She spoke at school about her work down at the state prison? - That's the one. - Her mother left her that big house. She thinks I'm lame in the head. You know what I think about her? She looks like the other side of a walnut, and if she don't watch out, she'll get cracked. My mother knows her slightly, and she thinks she's very nice. - Dig that. Your mother thinks she's nice. - Yes! Glenn, don't look for trouble. And by the way, my ma thinks you're nice too. - You didn't show her my letters, did you? - No. What about the other stuff I wrote? I want all that junk back, maybe burn it. Glenn, sometimes I think you're touched myself. Don't you trust anybody? ** [ Guitar] She's pretty. Pretty and sad. When's her husband coming back? They don't know. He's in government work overseas. So Uncle Rolfe says. When and where did she mar him? No one in town seems to know. - They don't say, I don't ask. - Yes, but-- Don't wor your heart.
