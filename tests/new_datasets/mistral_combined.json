The acting was brilliant, especially by Ulrich Tukur as the terrorist leader, who was calm, collected and deadly serious, yet somehow managed to be likable. This film explores many themes, such as religion, culture, politics and terrorism. The director does a great job of showing both sides of the story. One side is the terrorist, who feels wronged and seeks revenge. The other side is the pilot, who is a father and husband, trying to protect his family. The film also deals with the idea of good versus evil and how one man can change the fate of many others. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a thought provoking drama.",
