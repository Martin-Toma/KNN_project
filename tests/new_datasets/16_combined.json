While it is true that the majority of these troops were volunteers, they did not volunteer for peace, but for a war. The film covers the evolution of the Green Beret program in Vietnam from the start of the ground invasion in 1966 through the end of the U.S. presence in 1973. This includes coverage of the Mai Lai Massacre, the My Lai Trial, and other issues related to the handling of prisoners. The film also looks at the development of the Special Forces Program from the start in World War ll and takes a critical look at the treatment of the Green Berets in the news media in the 1970s and the 1980s. For instance, a reporter referred to the Green Berets as \"killer dervishes\", and a network executive suggested that the Green Berets were to blame for the Watergate scandal. The film does not shy away from covering the controversies that surrounded the Green Berets in the 1970s and 1980s. If you're looking for a detailed, balanced, and critical look at the Green Berets in Vietnam, this movie is for you.\"  \n}",

However, this movie was a bit unrealistic. The characters were mostly heroes, except for Stockburn and his deputies. They were portrayed as villains, which they were not. In reality, Stockburn was a hero, having defeated Indians, bandits, and outlaws. The truth is, there was no western outlaw gang called the Silver River Gang. They were a bunch of drifters who claimed they were working for Stockburn. The leader of the Silver River Gang was James Doolin, who was hanged in 1919. However, the movie shows them led by a character named John Farrenkopf, which is fictitious. Nevertheless, this movie remains one of my favorites, as it reminds me of my childhood growing up in San Diego.br br I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in the history of the American West.br br WARNING - Contains strong language.\", \"num\": 130236}",

The writing is average. But the director is the one to blame for the films failure.br br The film starts out with a bang, but quickly loses its steam. This is due to the fact that the story line lacks direction. The screenplay is choppy and disjointed. For instance, in the beginning, we follow a group of young adults and their everyday lives. A month later, we find out that the group members are actually former college roommates.br br Also, the plot is confusing. In the beginning, it appears as though Dennis Hopper is the main character. However, he is merely the voice of reason for the young adults. Later, it becomes apparent that the title refers to the young adults. This creates confusion.br br Overall, I found the ending of the film disappointing.br br I cannot recommend this film to others.\", \"num\": 3146746}",
