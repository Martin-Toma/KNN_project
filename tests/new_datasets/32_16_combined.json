While I had seen this film previously, I ordered it as I wanted to view it again and add it to my collection. It is a great story about a young man who falls in love with an older woman who is married. The film contains lots of dialogue and scenes that are interesting to watch. The acting is solid and moving. This film was made in the early 1960s and therefore has a vintage look that adds to the charm of the film. I recommend this DVD to lovers of quality films of this period.\", \"num\": 159391}",
