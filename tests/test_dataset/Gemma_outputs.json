The disjointed, time-loop structure creates tension, but the execution feels uneven—some scenes drag while others intrigue. The performances are solid, particularly the lead's emotional turmoil, but the plot's reliance on religious symbolism may polarize viewers. A thought-provoking yet flawed thriller with moments of intensity.\"\n}"

The dialogue is sharp and crude, fitting the hardened slayers' world, while the practical effects and gore deliver satisfyingly brutal vampire kills. The plot leans into religious horror tropes but keeps tension high with Valek's terrifying presence. Some pacing issues and underdeveloped characters hold it back, but fans of violent, no-nonsense horror will enjoy the ride.\"\n}"
