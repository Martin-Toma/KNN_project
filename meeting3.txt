1. Collect datasets
1.1: Download premade ones
https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahadrehman07/movie-reviews-and-emotion-dataset
https://huggingface.co/datasets/rohan2810/amazon-movies-meta-reviews-merged/tree/main
1.2: If not enough then scrape()
https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthemoviecalled/ (scrapeee)
1.3: Find model which can accomplish this task (e.g. ChatGPT + prompt,...) DONE
https://github.com/samuel-vitorino/MovieSearch
1.4 Prepare datasets -> csv[movie_title, review_desc, year,...] 
2. Train model (Falcon3 for now, next models maybe later if we have enough time...)
https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/Falcon3-7B-Instruct
2.1: Prepare scripts for training model 
python
2.2: Train model x (train on datasets, + Retrival-augmented generation(RAG)?)
3. Test model
3.1: Prepare("steal") scripts for model evaluation
3.2. Evaluate x's performance
- human evaluation - test dataset (cca. 100, hand picked)
- accuracy - (movie_name in output)
- range - generated film name -> real film name
- typos - grammar checker, garbled text...
-----------
4. Find a scholarly article and make a video
4. UI: CLI
5. Publish on hugging face (if the results are resasonable)
