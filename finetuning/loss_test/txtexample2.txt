"{\n  "rating": 7.5,\n  "genres": ["Drama", "Comedy", "Romance"],\n  "review": "This film is a raw and introspective exploration of modern adulthood, blending dark humor with poignant moments. The fragmented narrative and candid dialogue capture the protagonist's existential crisis and fleeting connections, though the pacing occasionally lags. Strong performances and a bittersweet tone make it compelling, even if it leaves some emotional threads unresolved."\n}"
