"{    "rating": 8.5,    "genres": ["Documentary", "Drama", "Biography"],    "review": "This deeply moving documentary explores the life of Owen Suskind, a young man with autism who finds connection and expression through Disney films. The film beautifully captures his journey from isolation to self-discovery, using Disney characters as a bridge to communication and emotional growth. Heartwarming and insightful, it highlights the power of storytelling and familial love. While occasionally heavy, its uplifting message and Owenâ€™s resilience make it a must-watch."  }"
