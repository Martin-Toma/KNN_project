    "review": "A fascinating dive into the underground world of Pez collecting, 'The Pez Outlaw' blends eccentric charm with a surprisingly gripping narrative. The film captures Steve Glew's audacious exploits with a mix of humor and tension, though it occasionally struggles with pacing. The documentary shines in its portrayal of obsession and the grey market, but some viewers might crave deeper insight into the broader Pez phenomenon. Still, it's an entertaining ride for niche-doc enthusiasts."
