This directory contains the files used for pretokenizing the datasets. The resulting files are a lot bigger than their json counterparts, but they occupy a lot less space compressed. 

Usage:
1. Download datasets (../dataset_splits/downloadDataset.sh)
2. Install required modules from requirements.txt
3. Replace "FILLMEIN" with your HuggingFace token
4. Run file and wait
